                <p>
                    If you are new to photography, you are probably still trying to wrap your head around what exposure
                    means.
                    Simply put, exposure refers to the amount of light that reaches your camera sensor or film.
                    Light will determine the quality and mood of your photograph. Thus it is essential to understand how
                    exposure works.
                    The best way to begin to master exposure is by understanding the exposure triangle.

                        Aperture is the size of the opening through which light enters the camera. How small or big this
                        opening can be is determined by the type of lens you are using. We define the size of the
                        aperture in f-stops. A smaller f-stop number means a larger aperture. Which means that f/1.4 is
                        a bigger
                        opening than f/22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aperture is important to master because it determines the depth of field of your photograph. The
                        depth of field refers to how much of the background is in focus or blurred. Using a shallow
                        depth of field means setting a large aperture (like f/1.4) to get a blurred background and an
                        isolated
                        subject. Using a deep depth of field means setting a small aperture (like f/22) to capture a
                        fully sharp image. Shallow depths of fields are commonly used for portraits, whereas deep depth
                        of
                        fields are used for landscape photography.

                        The shutter speed of your camera controls how long lights come into the camera. The more time
                        the shutter remains open, the more light enters the camera. Shutter speed also affects how your
                        photograph captures motion. A slower shutter speed will create a photograph with motion blur,
                        and a fast shutter speed will freeze the subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are working with a shutter speed below 1/60th of a second, a tripod is recommended
                        so that any motion comes from the subject and not from the photographer’s hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When setting the shutter to “BULB” mode you can manually keep your shutter open for longer than
                        the standard camera
                        settings. In these cases we recommend to use a remote along with the tripod, to avoid motion
                        blur from
                        directly pressing your camera’s shutter button.

            <h4 id="iso">ISO</h4>
            <p>
                ISO is difficult to explain in terms of digital cameras, but for film cameras it is basically the amount
                of chemicals on the film being used. The stronger the chemicals, the higher the ISO number, and the
                brighter the photograph. The lower the ISO number, the darker the photograph. ISO remains important for
                digital photography, and also controls how dark or bright your digital image will be.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may think that higher ISO numbers are better because they result in brighter photographs. However,
                the problem with using a high ISO is that your photo will have more grain. Lower ISO numbers are
                recommended, because they result in high quality images. That being said, when photographing dark
                subjects, such as the stars at night, you may need a high ISO. A good rule is to control the light first
                with the shutter
                speed and aperture, and then set a higher ISO if the image is still too dark.
